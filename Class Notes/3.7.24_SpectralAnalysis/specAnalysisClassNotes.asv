% Diba paper: Forward and reverse hippocampal place-cell sequences during ripples. 
% During sharpwave ripples, have forward replay (same order of neurons firing as animal moves along track)
% You also have sharpwave ripples when animal gets to the end of the track and consumes reward.
% The replay at this second sharpwave ripple happens backwards. Reverse replay.

% Dlta- 1 to 4Hz, in cortex and other regions, happens during during slow wave sleep.
% Theta- 5-10 Hz, in cortex, hippocamps, striatum and other regions. Neural communication, attention, working memory.
    % When rats run around, high hippocampal theta. 

% A large factor of LFP is the input to the cells. Spikes might be going elsewhere.

% Sharpwave ripple is composed of a slower sharpwave and a ripple typically in the trough. 
% SWRs originate in  the CA3 area of the Hippocampus. This area has a lot of excitatory inputs 
% Occur duirng quiesence and sleep
% SWRs define times of hippocampal replay.

% During sleep information can flow (classically unidirectionally) from HPC to cortex.
% Long term memories are storred in cortex??
% Motor memories don't need hippocampus.
